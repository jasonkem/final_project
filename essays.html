                <h2>Racial Analysis of Dominique Jones’ (Lil Baby) song, “The Bigger Picture.” & The Lies of America – Exposing America's False Narratives.</h2>
                <p>Reflecting on my essay from my freshman year on Dominique Jones' (Lil Baby) song "The Bigger Picture," I delved into the impact of systemic racism and police brutality highlighted in 2020, emphasizing the role of influential voices in the Black Lives Matter movement. Analyzing Lil Baby's integration of protest chants and personal experiences, I explored how he channels the frustrations and injustices faced by Black Americans into a powerful call for action and awareness. This piece allowed me to explore the broader implications of systemic injustices and the transformative power of music as a platform for advocacy and change.</p>
                <p>In another essay, "The Lies of America – Exposing America's False Narratives," I critiqued the pervasive myths that underpin the American identity, particularly regarding the nation's narrative as a land of opportunity. I examined historical and contemporary exploitation of minority groups, revealing how systemic inequalities are maintained through misleading narratives used by both corporations and the government. This essay was a profound journey through America's history of exploitation, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and challenging these narratives to truly understand the realities of American society and its impact on minority communities. Both essays significantly shaped my understanding of social issues and fueled my commitment to advocating for equity and justice.</p>
                <p>Throughout my academic journey, these essays have been instrumental in shaping my perspectives on social justice and the power of media in society. As I navigated through themes of systemic inequality, cultural narratives, and social movements, I learned to appreciate the complexity of societal issues and the critical role of informed, reflective discourse in driving change. These explorations have not only deepened my understanding but also solidified my resolve to engage actively in advocacy and educational efforts. My journey through these essays is a testament to the transformative power of education in cultivating a conscientious, informed, and proactive citizen ready to contribute positively in diverse spheres of life.</p>

            <h2>"Applying The Trees and the Forest Essay" &  "Boredom Buster"</h2>
            <p>In my essay titled "Applying The Trees and the Forest," I explored Alan Johnson's concept of "paths of least resistance" and how it interplays with the dynamics of culture and social structure. I delved into the formation of cultural aspects like beliefs, values, norms, and attitudes and how these collectively forge the frameworks within which we operate—essentially shaping our social behaviors and expectations. The idea that our actions are influenced by the cultural and structural elements to avoid conflicts and maintain societal balance resonated deeply with my experiences. For instance, as I navigated through various social roles—from being a student to a friend—the essay helped me articulate why we often conform to certain behaviors that seem most rewarding or least troublesome, guided by the underlying norms and values instilled in us.</p>
            <p>In the second essay, which revolved around my experiences with fashion trends during middle school, I reflected on how these social structures and cultural expectations influenced my personal choices and identity. I described the transformation from wearing mismatched outfits to adopting the popular styles dictated by my peers as I transitioned into a more popular social circle. This shift wasn't just about clothing but was a broader commentary on social acceptance and the internal conflict between personal preferences and societal expectations. The essay served as a powerful introspection into how we modify our behaviors and choices to align with the perceived norms of our social groups, illustrating the profound impact of societal structures on individual identity formation.</p>
            <p>These essays not only provided a framework for understanding my own social interactions but also fostered a deeper appreciation for the subtle yet powerful forces of culture and structure that govern our lives. They were a crucial part of my sophomore year, helping me connect theoretical knowledge with personal experiences, thereby enriching my academic journey and personal growth.</p>

        <h2>"Fortnite: Free Yet Competitive" & "PACT Analysis of Soccer Teams"</h2>
        <p>In the essay titled "Fortnite: Free Yet Competitive", I analyzed the overwhelming success of Fortnite, a leader in the online gaming market. Fortnite's innovative approach, including its "Battle Royal" mode, has not only captured but has maintained a vast audience, boasting about 80 million monthly users as of April 2021. My personal engagement with the game over two months provided a firsthand look at what makes Fortnite stand out. The game's accessibility—being free-to-play—parallels the concept of a public good, making it non-excludable and non-rivalrous, which fundamentally sets it apart from other games that require purchase. This model has not only enhanced its popularity but also fostered a loyal user base tolerant of typical gaming issues like server crashes because the financial investment is non-existent. I explored how Fortnite leverages a sophisticated matchmaking algorithm to improve user experience by ensuring players are paired with others of similar skill levels, which enhances engagement and satisfaction. This strategic approach to both accessibility and game design underpins Fortnite's sustained dominance in the gaming industry.</p>
        <p>My second essay focused on the PACT (People, Activities, Context, Technology) analysis of attending soccer matches, offering a comprehensive look at the multifaceted experience. This analysis covered everything from the strategic placement and infrastructure of stadiums to the timing of matches and the prevailing weather conditions. It highlighted how these factors collectively enhance or detract from the fan experience. The essay detailed the dynamics between players, fans, and officials, and the critical roles they play in the sports ecosystem. Additionally, I discussed how technology, particularly social media and advanced stadium technologies like instant replay systems, significantly influences fan engagement and the overall viewing experience. By dissecting these elements, the essay provided insights into how effectively managing these factors could significantly improve the enjoyment and accessibility of soccer games, making them more appealing and inclusive for fans worldwide.</p>
        <p>Both essays from my junior year showcase a deep dive into understanding complex systems—whether a digital game's ecosystem or a real-world sports event's logistics—and how these systems can be optimized to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. These reflections not only reinforced my analytical skills but also my appreciation for the nuanced interplay between technology, culture, and business strategies.</p>

    <h2>SI Capstone Proposal & "Ethical Dilemmas in Targeted Advertising: Navigating Privacy and Persuasion"</h2>
    <p>Reflecting on my senior year essays, I explored significant technological and ethical considerations that intersect heavily with everyday experiences and governance. In one project, I tackled the inefficiencies within Michigan's Central Procurement Services by proposing an automated system to enhance data extraction from state contracts. This initiative aimed to streamline procurement processes, saving time and resources while enhancing transparency and accountability in government operations.</p>
    <p>In another essay, I delved into the ethical dilemmas of targeted advertising, highlighting the thin line between personalized marketing and invasive privacy breaches. By examining the case of unsolicited pregnancy-related ads sent to a teenager, I underscored the critical need for ethical guidelines in digital advertising that prioritize user consent, transparency, and sensitivity to personal data.</p>
    <p>These projects not only reflect my growth in understanding complex systems and ethical frameworks but also reinforce my commitment to applying technological solutions thoughtfully and responsibly. As I move forward, these experiences will guide my efforts to ensure that innovation and ethics coexist to enhance societal and individual well-being in an increasingly digital world.</p>
