            <p>Hello! I'm a proud student at the University of Michigan, currently advancing my journey through the UMSI (School of Information) program, where I've dedicated my studies to Information Analysis. My passion for data and its transformative power has propelled me to extend my academic journey into a fifth year, during which I'll be pursuing a Master's degree in Big Data. This decision was fueled by the Accelerated Master's Program offered through our esteemed School of Information, designed to deepen my expertise and prepare me for the challenges and opportunities in the ever-evolving field of data science.</p>

            <p>Originally from Troy, MI, my journey has been one of constant learning, exploration, and application of knowledge in practical scenarios. Upon completion of my Master's program, I'm excited to start a new chapter of my professional life with KPMG in their Chicago office. This opportunity marks not just a transition from academia to the professional world but also a commitment to applying my skills in big data and information analysis to make meaningful contributions to one of the leading firms in the industry.</p>

            <p>As you navigate through my portfolio, you'll find a collection of projects and work that I've undertaken throughout my time at the university. Each project showcases my skills, dedication, and the continuous effort to leverage information for impactful decisions. Welcome to my showcase, and I look forward to sharing my journey with you.</p>
